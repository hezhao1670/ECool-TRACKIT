# ecool-trackit 
electron cooling simulation (Multi-particles tracking code)


includes: 
1. basic betatron motion, synchrotron motion, chromaticity, etc..
2. cooling: 3D non-magnetic cooling and dispersion
3. IBS: B-M IBS model with vertical dispersion
4. cooling section: several sections for hadron beam evolution (e-beam no change)  
5. add magnetized cooling force (Parkhomchuk, uniform e-beam) and energy/frequency tuning 
6. multi-injection (iichoice=3)
7 added various e-beam distribution uniform/elliptical/gaussian/hollw etc.
